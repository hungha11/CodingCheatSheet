# Coding Cheat Sheet


When you are coding, you will often find yourself writing the same code over and over again. This is where the Coding Cheet Sheet comes in. It is a collection of code snippets that you can use to write your code.


This cheat sheet is ,currently , the collection of my codes in three big aspects: Streamlit, Algorithmic Trading and Machine Leanring.

I will be very happy if someone can help me to improve this cheat sheet. In addition, if some one is interested in the trading and machine learning, I will be happy to share my codes as well as collaboration.
